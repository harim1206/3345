# 33/45

## Description

33/45 is a music player/library for your [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) collection. As an avid vinyl collector I have always found it frustrating not being able to easily browse, organize, and listen to my records. Yes, the whole point of records is that they are analog. However, when you own hundreds or thousands of them, you forget what half of them are or what they sound like. Wouldn’t it be nice to have an “iTunes” for your collection?

Especially for DJ’s whose purpose is to play the right record at the right time, nothing is more important than an intimate familiarity of his collection. Digital DJ’s can organize their library into different playlists by mood, genre, tempo, artist, label & others, which makes that right track instantaneously available. A vinyl DJ, in contrast, is praying the mood and tempo of record he just picked out matches his memory, after shuffling through his entire bag looking for it. A digital DJ can familiarize himself with his playlists on iTunes anytime anywhere, but a vinyl DJ has to be at his turntables at home. 33/45 solves this problem.

[Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) is the definitive database and marketplace for vinyl records, like a combination of IMDB & eBay. Entering a Discogs username into 33/45 pulls the user's collection from Discogs API (The website’s users’ collections are public). The application is built with React/Redux in the front end, and Ruby on Rails for the back end.
